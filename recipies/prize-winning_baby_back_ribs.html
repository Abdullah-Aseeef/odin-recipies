    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon ground cumin
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon chili powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon paprika
        </li>
        <li>
            salt and pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            3 pounds baby back pork ribs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup barbeque sauce
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Preheat a gas grill for high heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes on one side of the barbeque. Lightly oil the grate.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small jar; close the lid and shake to mix.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Trim the membrane sheath from the back of each rack. Run a small, sharp knife between the membrane and each rib, and snip off the membrane as much as possible.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Sprinkle as much of the rub onto both sides of ribs as desired. To prevent ribs from becoming too dark and spicy, do not thoroughly rub spices into ribs. Store any unused spice mix in a jar for future use.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
